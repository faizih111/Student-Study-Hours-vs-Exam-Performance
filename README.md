# Student Performance Analysis (Machine Learning Basics)

This project applies basic **Machine Learning concepts** learned from the W3Schools tutorial to analyze and predict student performance based on study hours, exam scores, and other factors.

## ðŸ“– Concepts Covered
- Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python  
- Mean, Median, and Mode calculations  
- Standard Deviation and Percentiles  
- Data Distribution and Normal Distribution  
- Scatter Plots for visualization  
- Linear Regression (using SciPy)  
- Polynomial Regression  
- Multiple Regression (with scikit-learn)  
- Scaling data for better accuracy  
- Train/Test Split for evaluation  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- **data/** â†’ Arrays storing student exam scores, study hours, and sleep hours  
- **analysis/** â†’ Statistical calculations (mean, std dev, percentiles)  
- **visualization/** â†’ Scatter plots, regression lines, and polynomial curves  
- **models/** â†’ Linear, polynomial, and multiple regression implementations  

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Python  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To practice **fundamental Machine Learning techniques** using only concepts introduced in the W3Schools tutorial, and visualize how different study habits relate to exam performance.
